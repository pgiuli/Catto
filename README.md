# Catto
Automated pop-up cats!

In order for the script to run correctly create a **.env** file in the root folder with the following:
```
subrredit = 'cats'
base64 = 'True/False'

client_id = '' 
client_secret = ''
reddit_username = ''
password = ''


user_agent = ''

cat_hotkey = 'F3+c'
stop_hotkey = 'F3+b'
```
client_id, client_secret, reddit_username and password must be base64 encoded if ```base64 = 'True'```.
